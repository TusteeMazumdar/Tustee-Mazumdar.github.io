## ðŸ‘‹ Greetings!** 
I'm **Tustee Mazumdar**, a self-motivated research enthusiast.  My research interests are Natural Language Processing (NLP), Crisis Informatics, Data Mining & AI for Social Good. I recently graduated from the Asian University for Women, majoring in Computer Science. Currently preparing for PhD applications, I develop AI solutions for social good with a focus on:  

-**Climate change communication** (SDG-13)  
- **Multitask learning architectures**




I have been assisting in courses - CS50 (Harvard Online Course), Calculus, Computer Literacy, and Precalculus. 

I'm actively seeking research collaborations in natural language processing, particularly in: low-resource NLP, multitask learning, and AI for social good applications. Whether you're working on novel architectures, dataset creation, or real-world NLP implementations, I'd love to connect. Feel free to reach me at tustee.mazumder@auw.edu.bd or via LinkedIn to discuss potential collaborations.
